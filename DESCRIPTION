Description: Utility functions to georeference bat calls collected during mobile
    acoustical transects and assist with the quality control of collected data. In
    this particular application, calls were recorded with the Anabat SD2 and the
    older Anabat SD1 (Titley Scientific; http://www.titley-scientific.com/) with an
    attached GPS and identified using the Bat Call Identification software (http://
    batcallid.com).
