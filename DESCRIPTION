Description: Utility functions to georeference bat calls collected during mobile

    this particular application, calls were recorded with the Anabat SD2 and the
    older Anabat SD1 (Titley Scientific; http://www.titley-scientific.com/) with an
    attached GPS and identified using the Bat Call Identification software (http://
    batcallid.com).
