MABM (Mobile Acoustical Bat Monitoring)
=======================================

This package contains functions for the creation, visualization, and quality assurance and control of spatial data associated with the USFWS Mobile Acoustical Bat Monitoring (MABM) program.

Installing MABM
---------------

The MABM package requires you to have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (\>= 3.2.1) installed on your computer as well as [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Both will require administrative priveleges but the installation of packages after this initial install will not.

With R and Rtools installed, install and load the MABM package to access its functionality:

    install.packages("devtools") # Only the first time
    library("devtools")
    install_github("adamdsmith/MABM") # Only the first time

**Use `readr 0.1.1` package: The current version of `readr` package has introduce a bug into one of its functions used by `MABM`. Thus, we need to make sure that an older version of `readr` is installed until this is fixed.**

    packageurl <- "http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/readr/readr_0.1.1.tar.gz"
    install.packages(packageurl, repos=NULL, type="source")
    # Now load MABM
    library("MABM")

Using MABM
----------

Basic operations are illustrated below. For details on the arguments and options available in each function, see their associated help files: `?MABM_route` or `?plot_MABM_route`.

### Georeferencing bat detections

Typically the `MABM_route` function will be used to join an Excel spreadsheet of bat detection classifications created by Bat Call Identification ([BCID](http://www.batcallid.com)) with a text file of GPS fixes collected simultaneously. In short, the function georeferences bat calls recorded along the route and prepares a *.csv file of georeferenced bat call classifications for import in the the MABM program Access database. In addition to the *.csv file for database import, the function creates three ESRI shapefiles for detailed QA/QC of the bat survey route: a point shapefile of the GPS log, a route (line) shapefile that connects all GPS fixes chronologically into a single shape, and a point shapefile of each georeferenced bat detection. Finally, the default settings look within the selected directory for [Anabat](http://www.titley-scientific.com/us/index.php/anabat-bat-detector) audio files that have been generated by [CF Read](http://www.titley-scientific.com/us/index.php/software_firmware) and move those files not classified by BCID (and thus suspected as noise based on user settings in CF Read) into a separate subdirectory.

This is the output produced when using the default options and can be accomplished by calling the function with no listed arguments:

``` r
MABM_route()
```

First a dialog box opens that asks the user to specify the MABM route from which the data were collected (NOTE: some "locations" have multiple routes, so choose wisely). In this example, we select Big Lake NWR. The abbreviation for the selected route (e.g., "BglNWR") will be used (with the date of the survey) to name the resulting files.

![Choose your survey route](./README-figs/choose_route.png)

A second dialog box prompts the user to specify the fixed width text file containing the logged GPS points.

A third and final dialog box asks for the Microsoft Excel file produced by the Bat Call Identification software.

![Choose the BCID Excel file](./README-figs/choose_BCID.png)

Once these are selected, the function creates a new directory in the same folder as the GPS text file that contains a comma-delimited (\*.csv) text file that can be directly imported into the MABM Access database and three shapefiles as described above. Suspected noise files are scrubbed (moved) to a new subdirectory; if no Anabat files or suspected noise files are detected in the directory, scrubbing is ignored. The user is alerted of this activity in the R console:

![Finished!](./README-figs/all_done.png)

### Visualizing the route and bat detections

With the survey route shapefiles created, the `plot_MABM_route` function allows the user to visualize the route and detections without the need to open ArcMap. We use the [leaflet package](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet) package to facilitate interactivity.

There is only a single argument the user is likely to specify --- how to define a "bad" GPS fix for a bat call detection (`badgps`; default is no GPS fix within 5 seconds of the detection).

For the Big Lake route we georeferenced, we can visualize the route and bat detections using the default options with:

``` r
plot_MABM_route()
```

This will open a dialog box asking the user to locate the point shapefile created from the GPS log. This should begin with "SavedRoute".

![Choose the route shapefile](./README-figs/choose_shapefile.png)

The location of the detection point shapefile (begins with "Calls") is inferred automatically based on the GPS point shapefile. Thus it is assumed that shapefiles were created using the `MABM_route` function (or at least according to its conventions).

This produces an interactive plot of the route and bat detections (view an interactive version of this README **[here](http://rpubs.com/adamsmith_fws/MABM_readme)**.):

![Output](./README-figs/plot_output.png)

A choice of a terrain or aerial imagery basemap is available; aerial imagery has been toggled on in this example.

The route is shaded with a gradient indicating how much time (in minutes) has elapsed since the GPS acquired its first fix; the beginning of the route is blue and transitions to red at its completion. Large gaps in the route (e.g., due to GPS failure) should be apparent if they are present. Clicking on a GPS point along the route provides some information regarding that point (e.g., date, time, elapsed time since survey start).

Bat detections are indicated by bat icons along the route. Bat icons are colored based on their species classification from the software; these colors will *not* change from route to route so learning them may facilitate interpretation in future plots. Users can toggle the visibility of "good" and "bad" GPS fixes (as defined by the user; see `?plot_MABM_route`), using the layers control feature in the upper right corner of the map. Clicking on a bat icon reveals some information about the detection (e.g., time, species, seconds from the nearest [in time] GPS fix).
